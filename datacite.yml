title: "Massively parallel multi-electrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during an instructed delayed reach-to-grasp task"

# Any additional information. It is best practice to supply a description for the resource.
description: |
    We provide two electrophysiological datasets recorded via a 10-by-10 multi-electrode array chronically implanted in the motor cortex of two macaque monkeys during an instructed delayed reach-to-grasp task. The datasets contain the continuous measure of extracellular potentials at each electrode sampled at 30 kHz, the local field potentials sampled at 1 kHz and the timing of the online and offline extracted spike times. It also includes the timing of several task and behavioral events recorded along the electrophysiological data. Finally, the datasets provide a complete set of metadata structured in a standardized format. These metadata allow easy access to detailed information about the datasets such as the settings of the recording hardware, the array specifications, the location of the implant in the motor cortex, information about the monkeys, or the offline spike sorting.
